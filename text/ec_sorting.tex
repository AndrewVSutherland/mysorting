curves defined over an arbitrary number field, including sorting and
labelling isogeny classes, and curve in each isogeny class.


\section{Sorting isogenous elliptic curves}

\subsection{Elliptic curve labels}

Labels for elliptic curves over number fields (including $\Q$ have
three components: a label for the conductor, a label for each isogeny
class with that conductor, and a label for each curve in its isogeny
class.

Since conductors are integral ideals we can label them according to
the previous section.

For a fixed conductor each isogeny class is uniquely determined by the
traces of Frobenius $a_{\p}(E)$.  Here we include primes of bad
reduction in the usual way: $a_{\p}(E)=+1$ for split multiplicative
reduction, $-1$ for non-split and $0$ for additive reduction.  Now we
can sort the isogeny classes of any fixed conductor by
lexicographically ordering the sequence of $a_{\p}(E)$ with the
primes~$\p$ ordered as in the previous section.  Having done that,
each isogeny class has an index in the order; we base the indices
at~$0$ and convert to base 26 using ``digits'' $a=0$, $b=1$, $\dots$,
$z=25$, obtaining a string from the list $a, b, \dots, z, ba, bb,
\dots$.

Remarks: 1. In the LMFDB at present (June 2016) the isogeny class
labels follow this scheme for imaginary quadratic fields since there
the primes are sorted as in the previous section.  However the class
labels for elliptic curves over totally real fields are taken from the
labels of the associated Hilbert modular forms, whose ordering is not
necessary well-defined as described above.  This is a historical
accident.

2. Over $\Q$ the LMFDB labels for elliptic curves follow this but the
Cremona labels do not for conductors up to $230000$.  Again this is a
historical phenomenon.

Finally, the curves in each isogeny class are sorted in some way and
hence given a numerical index, starting at 1, which forms the third
part of the label.  In the rest of this section we describe methods
used to sort the curves in each isogeny class.

\subsection{Over \texorpdfstring{$\Q$}{\bf Q}}

Every elliptic curve over $\Q$ has a unique Weierstrass model which is
integral, globally minimal and with coefficients $a_1,a_3\in\{0,1\}$
and $a_3\in\{-1,0,1\}$.  We sort the curves using this coefficient
vector $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_6)$.  In fact, within on isogeny class the
triple $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ is constant (see \cite{Siksek}), so it suffices
to sort on $(a_4,a_6)$.

This is the sorting used for the LMFDB labels for elliptic curves over
$\Q$.  It differs from the Cremona labelling, in which the ``strong
Weil'' or $\Gamma_0(N)$-optimal curve is number~$1$ and the others are
labelled in the order of being computed from the first.  At some point
the latter became completely deterministic and has been documented
elsewhere, but the details are not relevant here.

There are many reasons why a system of ordering isogenous curves using
Weierstrass models is hopeless over almost all number fields (the only
exceptions, perhaps, being the $7$ imaginary quadratic fields having
only $\pm1$ as units, and class number~$1$).  There may be no global
minimal model, in which case some ``semi-global minimal'' model is
stored in the LMFDB; even when there is a global minimal model,
scaling by units results in infinitely many such models, even up to
translation (except for imaginary quadratic fields where the number is
finite).

Instead we have devised a system of sorting isogenous curves which
does not depend on the model, based on the simple observation (see the
next subsection) that in almost all cases isogenous curves have
distinct $j$-invariants.  It would be possible to use this new system
over $\Q$, but as there are already two labelling systems we do not
propose this!

\subsection{Over arbitrary number fields}

The basic fact we need is that in almost all cases, the elliptic
curves in an isogeny class have distinct $j$-invariants.

\begin{thm}
Let $K$ be a number field and let $E_1$, $E_2$ elliptic curves defined
over~$K$ that are isogenous over $K$ but not isomorphic over $K$.
Then either
\begin{enumerate}
\item $j(E_1)\not=j(E_2)$; or
\item $j(E_1)=j(E_2)$, and $E_1$ and $E_2$ both have CM by an
  imaginary quadratic order $\OO$ of discriminant~$D<0$ for which
  $\sqrt{D}\notin K$ (so that the extra endomorphisms are not defined
  over~$K$); $E_1$ and $E_2$ become isomorphic over $L=K(\sqrt{D})$;
  and there is a rational cyclic isogeny $\phi\colon E_1\to E_2$ of
  degree $|D|$ (if $D$ is odd), $|D|/4$ (if $D$ is even and
  $D\not=-4$) or~$2$ (if $D=-4$).
\end{enumerate}
Conversely, if $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over $K$ with CM by an
order of discriminant~$D$ not contained in~$K$, then the quadratic
twist of $E$ by $\sqrt{D}$ is isogenous but not isomorphic to~$E$
over~$K$; thus the isogeny class of $E$ consists of pairs of curves,
the curves in each pair being quadratic twists that are isomorphic
over $K(\sqrt{D})$ with CM by a quadratic order $\OO$ in that
field. The order $\OO$ is the same for each pair of quadratic twists,
but may vary between pairs.

\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ be an isogeny defined over~$K$; without loss of
generality we may take $\phi$ to be cyclic (since otherwise it factors
through the multiplication-by-$m$ map $[m]$ on $E_1$ for some $m>1$).

Assume that $j(E_1)=j(E_2)$.  Then there is an isomorphism
$\alpha:E_2\to E_1$ defined over an extension $L/K$ of degree at
most~$6$, and no such isomorphism defined over $K$ itself, by
assumption.

The composite $\psi=\alpha\circ\phi$ is a cyclic endomorphism of $E_1$
of degree~${}>1$, which implies that $\End(E_1)\ne \Z$, so $E_1$ (and
therefore also $E_2$) has CM by some imaginary quadratic order~$\OO$, of
discriminant $D$, say.  Now $\psi$ is defined over $L=K(\sqrt{D})$,
and $L$ contains the field of definition of~$\alpha$, showing that
$[L:K]=2$ and that $\alpha$ is defined over~$L$.  Hence $E_1$ and
$E_2$ become isomorphic over the quadratic extension~$L$ of $K$.

Let $\sigma$ denote the nontrivial element of $\Gal(L/K)$.

Assume first that $j\not=0, 1728$, or equivalently that $D\not=-3,-4$.
Since the only nontrivial automorphism of $E_1$ is $[-1]$ it follows
that $\alpha^{\sigma}=-\alpha$, where $-\alpha=[-1]\circ\alpha$. Hence
$\psi^{\sigma}=-\psi$ (where again $-\psi=[-1]\circ\psi$).  Viewing
$\psi$ as an element of the abstract order~$\OO$, this means that
$\psi$ is ``pure imaginary''.  Moreover, the fact that $\psi$ has
cyclic kernel implies that $\psi$ is not divisible in~$\OO$ by any
integer $n>1$.  If $D$ is odd, so that $\OO=\Z[(1+\sqrt{D})/2]$, this
implies that $\psi=\pm\sqrt{D}$, so $\deg\psi=|D|$.  If $D$ is even
then $\OO=\Z[(1+\sqrt{D})/2]$ and $\psi=\pm\sqrt{D}/2$ with degree
$|D|/4$.

Suppose that $j=0$ and $D=-3$.  Without loss we may assume that $E_1$
has equation $Y^2=X^3+a$ with $a\in K^*$; since $E_2$ becomes
isomorphic to $E_1$ over the quadratic extension $K(\sqrt{-3})$, it is
isomorphic to $Y^2=X^3+a'$ where $a'/a$ represents a nontrivial
element of the kernel of the map $K^*/(K^*)^6 \to L^*/(L^*)^6$, but
the only such element (up to 6th powers) is $-27$ (easy exercise).
Hence without loss of generality $E_2$ has equation $Y^2=X^3-27a$, and
standard formulas show that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are $3$-isogenous.  To see
the last part directly, one isomorphism $E_1\to E_2$ is given by
$(x,y)\mapsto(-3x,-3\sqrt{-3}y)$ so that as in the generic case
$\alpha^{\sigma}=-\alpha$ and $\psi$ is pure imaginary, hence
$\psi=\pm\sqrt{-3}$ with degree~$3$.

Finally suppose that $j=1728$ and $D=-4$, so $L=K(\sqrt{-1})$.  The
kernel of $K^*/(K^*)^4 \to L^*/(L^*)^4$ has order~$2$ with non-trivial
element represented by~$-4$, and hence without loss of generality we
may suppose that $E_1$ has equation $Y^2=X^3+aX$ and $E_2:
Y^2=X^3-4aX$ for some $a\in K^*$.  Again it is well-known that these
are $2$-isogenous.  Alternatively, an explicit computation (similar to
that for $j=0$) shows that $\psi=\pm1\pm i$ with degree~$2$; note that
in this case $\alpha^{\sigma}\not=\pm\alpha$; instead,
$\alpha^{\sigma}=\epsilon\circ\alpha$ where $\epsilon\in\Aut(E_1)$ has
order~$4$.

For the last part, let $E$ have CM by the order $\OO$ of
discriminant~$D<0$ with $\sqrt{D}\notin K$.  Set $L=K(\sqrt{D})$ and
let $E'$ be the $\sqrt{D}$-twist of $E$.  Assume first that
$D\not=-4$; then $\OO$ contains a pure imaginary element $\psi$ which
when composed with an isomorphism $\alpha:E'\to E$ gives an isogeny
$\phi=\alpha\circ\psi:E_1\to E_2$, defined over~$K$.  For the case
$D=-4$, when $\sqrt{-1}\notin K$, we take an equation for $E$ of the
form $Y^2=X^3+aX$, set $E': Y^2=X^3-4aX$ and observe that $E$ and $E'$
are $2$-isogenous, not isomorphic over $K$ but isomorphic over
$K(\sqrt{-1})$ where $-4$ becomes a $4$th power.

\end{proof}

\subsection{Sorting isogenous elliptic curves over number fields}

The theorem in the last subsection says that, for any isogeny class of
curves defined over~$K$ which either do not have CM or which have
``rational CM'' (meaning that the extra endomorphisms are defined over
$K$ itself), the $j$-invariants of the curves in the class are
distinct; we may therefore sort the curves using their $j$-invariants
as in Section~1.

However, in the case where the curves in the isogeny class do have
rational CM, we adjust this sorting scheme as follows.  Observe that
when two elliptic curves are isogenous, if one has CM then so does the
other, and their endomorphism rings are (isomorphic to) orders in the
same imaginary quadratic field, though in general different orders.
In the case of rational CM, we first sort by the absolute value of the
CM discriminant; this means that curves which have the same
endomorphism ring are grouped together.  The number of isomorphism
classes in each of these ``clusters'' of curves is equal to the class
number of the associated CM discriminant.  Within each cluster, the
$j$-invariants are distinct, though Galois conjugate, and we sort them
as in Section~1.

It remains to consider isogeny classes of curves with CM by an order
in an imaginary quadratic field $\Q(\sqrt{d})$ where $\sqrt{d}\notin
K$.  As before, if any one curve in the isogeny class has this
property, then all $K$-isogenous curves also do, though they may have
CM by different orders in $\Q(\sqrt{d})$.  As in the rational CM case,
we first sort by the absolute value of the CM discriminant, and then
by the $j$-invariant, but now there will be exactly two curves for
which these are the same, which are $\sqrt{d}$-twists of each other.

Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be $\sqrt{d}$-twists of each other with CM by the
same order in $\Q(\sqrt{d})$.  As we have seen, they are necessarily
isogenous over $K$ and in particular have the same conductor~$\n$.
Let $j=j(E_1)=j(E_2)$.  We may distinguish the curves using a prime
ideal $\p$ of $K$ with certain properties.  Consider the set of
primes~$\p$ of $K$ lying above a rational prime~$p$, such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ does not divide $6dN_{K/\Q}(\n)$;
\item $p$ does not divide $\disc g$, where $g$ is the defining polynomial
  of~$K$.
\item the Legendre symbol $(d/p)=-1$;
\item $\p$ has degree~$1$, and hence residue field~$\F_p$;
\item $\ord_{\p}(j-1728)=0$ if $j\not=1728$, otherwise $\ord_{\p}(j)=0$;
\end{enumerate}
Conditions (1), (2) and~(5) only exclude finitely many primes; (4)
excludes a set of density~$0$; and (3) still leaves a set of primes of
$K$ of density~$1/2$.  Using our ordering of primes we can let $\p$ be
the \textit{first} prime of $K$ with all the above properties, and
because of condition~(2), we only need use the simple form of ordering
of primes of equal norm based on the factorization of $g(X)$
modulo~$p$.  Note that the conditions we put on $\p$ are independent
of the models for $E_1$ and~$E_2$.

In the case $j\not=1728$, we can assume that $E_1$ and $E_2$ have
equations $Y^2=X^3+aX+b$ and $Y^2=X^3+d^2aX+d^3b$ respectively, with
$b\not=0$.  The conditions on $\p$ imply that the coefficients $a,b$
of the model for $E_1$ may be chosen so that $\p\nmid b$.  Hence
exactly one of $b$, $bd^3$ is a quadratic residue modulo~$\p$, and we
can use this distinction to order $E_1$ and~$E_2$.  In order to do
this without having to change models, take any integral model for
$E_1$ with invariants $c_4$, $c_6$ and $\Delta$, where
$j-1728=c_6^2/\Delta$; if $\p\nmid c_6$, which will be true unless the
model is non-minimal at~$\p$, we compute the Legendre symbol
$(c_6\pmod{\p}/p)=\pm1$ and put $E_1$ first if and only if the value
is $+1$.  In case our model is non-minimal at~$\p$, we will have
$\ord_{\p}(c_6)=6k$ and $\ord_{\p}(\Delta)=12k$ for some $k\ge1$.  Now
take $\pi$ a uniformiser at~$\p$ which has non-positive valuations at
all other primes and compute the symbol $(c_6/\pi^{6k}\pmod{\p}/p)$.
Clearly the resulting value $\pm1$ is independent of the choice of
model.

A similar analysis works when $j=1728$ using $c_4$ in place of $c_6$,
using the value of the Legendre symbol $(c_4/\pi^{4k}\pmod{\p}/p)$
where $\ord_{\p}(c_4)=4k\ge0$ and $c_4$ is the invariant of any
integral model for $E_1$.

This completes the task of sorting isogenous curves with the same
$j$-invariant in a model-independent way, and hence of sorting each
isogeny class of curves.  In summary, we sort the curves in each
isogeny class using as key the triple $(|D|,j,\epsilon)$ attached to
each elliptic curve $E$ in the isogeny class, where
\begin{itemize}
\item $D=\disc\End(E)$ (so $D<0$ if $E$ has CM, otherwise $D=1$);
\item $j=j(E)$, ordered as in Section~1;
\item $\epsilon\in\{-1,1\}$ is minus the value of the Legendre symbol
  defined above when $E$ has CM but not rational CM, and $\epsilon=0$
  otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\section{Minimal twists of elliptic curves}

\subsection{Basic notions}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over the number field~$K$.  The
twists of $E$ are the other elliptic curves $E'$ defined over~$K$ with
$j(E)=j(E')$, or equivalently such that $E$ and~$E'$ become isomorphic
over an extension of~$K$.

When $j(E)\not=0,1728$ all twists of $E$ are \textit{quadratic twists}
$E'=E^{(d)}$ which are isomorphic to~$E$ over quadratic
extensions~$K(\sqrt{d})/K$; these are parametrized by $K^*/(K^*)^2$.
For $j=1728$ and $j=0$, respectively, we must consider
\textit{quartic} and \textit{sextic} twists, parametrized
by~$K^*/(K^*)^4$ and $K^*/(K^*)^6$.  One can handle all these cases in
one by saying that the twists of~$E$ are parametrized by
$H^1(G_K,\Aut(E))$ where $G_K=\Gal(\Qbar/K)$, but here we will use the
more elementary language since we want to be as explicit as possible.

Our aim in this section is to define a \textit{minimal quadratic
  twist} for every elliptic curve, and also a \textit{minimal twist}
to cover the two exceptional $j$-invariants.  For $j(E)\not=0,1728$
the minimal quadratic twist of $E$ depends only on $j(E)$, so our
definition involves picking out a unique well-defined representative
curve with each $j$-invariant.

For minimal representatives with respect to the higher order twists,
we can simply pick out one curve with $j=0$ and one with $j=1728$. For
example, the curve with LMFDB label 27.a4 (Cremona label 27a3) has
$j=0$, minimal conductor~$27$ (among all elliptic curves defined
over~$\Q$ with $j(E)=0$) and minimal discriminant $-27$ (among all
curves $j(E)=0$ and conductor~$27$).  Similarly, 32.a3 (Cremona label
32a2) has minimal conductor $32$ and minimal discriminant $64$ among
those with $j(E)=1728$.  Nevertheless, we will also define minimal
quadratic twists for these $j$-invariants.

In general we require that the definition of which curve is the
minimal quadratic twist should depend only on the isomorphism class of
the curves and not on properties of the specific models used.  In many
cases it will suffice to consider the norms of the conductor~$\n$ and
of the \textit{minimal discriminant ideal}~$\d$ (defined below), but
we will need to examine further the situation where more than one
quadratic twist has the same values for both of these.

Recall that the minimal discriminant ideal is the integral ideal
$\prod\p^{d_{\p}}$ whose valuation at each prime~$\p$ is that of the
discriminant of the local minimal model at~$\p$.  For every
Weierstrass model of $E$ with discriminant $\Delta\in K^*$ we have
$(\Delta)=\n\u^{12}$ for some fractional ideal~$\u$, and for every
other Weierstrass model with discriminant~$\Delta'$ we have
$\Delta'/\Delta\in (K^*)^{12}$.  Hence the class of $\Delta$ modulo
$12$th powers is a well-defined invariant of~$E$, as is the ideal
class $[\u]$ of~$\u$.  This class is trivial if and only if $E$
possesses a global minimal model.

We first consider the case~$K=\Q$.

\subsection{Minimal quadratic twists over \texorpdfstring{$\Q$}{\textbf Q}}

We start by studying the situation where two elliptic curves $E_1$
and~$E_2$ defined over~$\Q$, which are quadratic twists by $d$, have
the same \textit{minimal discriminant}~$\Delta_{\text{min}}$.

\begin{prop} Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be elliptic curves defined over~$\Q$
  which are non-isomorphic quadratic twists with the same minimal
  discriminant.  Then $E_2$ is the $-1$-twist of~$E_1$, and
  $j(E_1)=j(E_2)\not=1728$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $E_2$ is the $d$-twist of $E_1$, where without loss of
generality $d$ is square-free, and $d\not=1$.  For a suitable choice
of Weierstrass models, the discriminants of~$E_1$ and~$E_2$ are
$\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2=d^6\Delta_1$.  Since both sides are
well-defined modulo $12$th powers and
$\Delta_1\equiv\Delta_2\pmod{(\Q^*){}^{12}}$, it follows that $d^6$ is a
$12$th power, which implies that $d=\pm1$ (since $d$ is square-free)
and so $d=-1$.  For the last part, if $j(E_1)=j(E_2)=1728$, then with
the same models the ratio of the $c_4$-invariants is $d^2=1$, giving
$E_1\cong E_2$.  (In this case, $E_1$ is its own $-1$-twist.)
\end{proof}

Now fix a rational $j$-invariant $j$.  Among all elliptic curves $E$
defined over~$\Q$ with $j(E)=j$, there is a finite subset with minimal
conductor~$N$, and a subset of those for which
$\left|\Delta_{\text{min}}\right|$ is minimal.  If this subset
contains precisely one isomorphism class of curves, we define that to
be the minimal quadratic twist.  Otherwise, the proposition shows that
$j\not=1728$ and the subset contains precisely two curves which are
$-1$-twists of each other.  Now the ratio of their $c_6$-invariants,
which is well-defined modulo $6$th powers, is $(-1)^3=-1$, so exactly
one of the two curves has positive $c_6$, and we choose this one as
the minimal quadratic twist.

\begin{rem}
An alternative way to break the tie in the last situation, which is
similar to the system proposed above for sorting isogenous quadratic
twists, would be to take the first prime $p>3$ of good reduction and
congruent to~$3\pmod4$ and pick the curve for which $(c_6/p)=+1$.  The
method proposed here is simpler.
\end{rem}

In practice we can find the minimal quadratic twist of a curve $E$ as
follows.  Start with an integral short Weierstrass model
$Y^2=X^3+aX+b$ for $E$.  For each prime~$p$ dividing $\gcd(a,b)$, let
$k$ be maximal such that $p^{2k}\mid a$ and $p^{3k}\mid b$, and
replace $(a,b)$ by~$(a/p^{2k},b/p^{3k})$.  This gives a curve~$E_1$
which it is easy to see is the minimal twist of~$E$ at all
primes~$p>3$.  Now compute the $d$-twists of~$E_1$ for
$d\in\{\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm6\}$, or just $d\in\{1,2,3,6\}$ if
$j(E)=1728$, and discard first those whose conductor is not minimal,
and then those whose minimal discriminant is non-minimal among the
curves still remaining. This will leave either one or two curves
remaining; in the latter case exactly one will have positive $c_6$, we
discard the other, and are left with the minimal quadratic twist.
