\title{Notes on labelling and sorting number fields, number field
  elements and ideals}
\author{John Cremona, Aurel Page, and Andrew V. Sutherland}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

These notes set out a scheme for labelling and sorting number fields,
elements of number fields, and ideals of number fields (including
prime ideals as a special case).  We have implemented algorithms which
realise this scheme, in \Sage, \Magma\ and~\Pari.

\section{Sorting number field elements}
\subsection{Defining the number field}
We assume that every number field $K$ is given in the form
$K=\Q(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer whose
minimal polynomial $g(X)$ is canonically determined by the field $K$.
In practice, $g(X)$ is the
polynomial returned by the \Pari\ function {\tt polredabs} which
is guaranteed to always return the same polynomial, given any
polynomial defining a number field isomorphic to $K$.  This canonical
polynomial $g(X)$ is thus fixed one and for all; it is monic and
integral.

We do not assume that $\Z[\alpha]$ is the full ring of integers
$\OO_K$.  Indeed, for most number fields $K$ this condition is
not satisfied by any choice of $\alpha$ (in general the ring $\OO_K$
will not be monogenic over $\Z$).

We emphasize that both the defining polynomial $g(X)$ and the generator
$\alpha$ of~$K$ are fixed.  In other words we are fixing the structure
of $K=\Q[X]/(g(X))$ not just as a field, but as a $\Q[X]$-algebra, where the
structure map $\Q[X]\to K$ has kernel $(g(X))$ and $\alpha$ is the
image of $X$ in $K$.

\subsection{Ordering the elements of a fixed number field}\label{sec:ordfix}
Given $K=\Q(\alpha)$ as above, with degree $d=[K:\Q]=\deg f$, every
element $\beta\in K$ can be uniquely expressed as a polynomial in
$\alpha$ of degree at most $d-1$, say
$\beta=\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}b_i\alpha^i$, and we use the coefficient vector
$(b_0,b_1,\dots,b_{d-1})\in\Q^d$ as a sorting key, where $\Q^d$ is
sorted lexicographically.  To remove any ambiguity, if
$\gamma=\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}c_i\alpha^i$ then $\beta<\gamma$ if and only
if we have $b_i<c_i$ for the \textit{least} index~$i$ such that $b_i\not=c_i$.

The induced ordering on $\Q$ viewed as a subset of $K$
is the same as the standard ordering of $\Q$

\subsection{An incomplete alternative sorting method}

If $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are algebraic numbers contained in a number
field $K$ then we may order them as above, but we should note that
this ordering depend on $K$ (and our fixed representation $K=\Q(\alpha)$).
The order may change if we enlarge $K$; for example, in the field
$K=\Q(\alpha):=\Q[X]/(X^3-X^2+1)$ we have $\alpha-\alpha^2 < \alpha$
(because $(0,1,-1) < (0,1,0)$), but if we
embed $K$ in its Galois closure $$L=\Q(\beta):=\Q[X]/(X^6 - 3X^5 + 5X^4 - 5X^3 + 5X^2 - 3X + 1)$$
via the map $\pi:K\to L$ defined by  $\pi(\alpha) = \beta^5 - 2\beta^4 + 2\beta^3 - \beta^2 + 2\beta$,
in the field $L$ we have $\pi(\alpha-\alpha^2) > \pi(\alpha)$
(because $(2,-4,5,-5,3,-1)>(0,2,-1,2,-2,1)$).

It is tempting to try to define an ordering on $\Qbar$ that would
allow us to consistently order all algebraic numbers, independent
of a choice an ambient number field.  Every $\beta\in\Qbar$ is a root of a
unique irreducible primitive polynomial $g(X)\in\Z[X]$  with positive
leading coefficient.  Using the coefficient sequence
of $g$ as a key, we can unambiguously  compare any two non-conjugate algebraic
numbers. By first sorting on $\deg(g)$ we can ensure that algebraic numbers of
lower degree come before those of higher degree.

However, to obtain a total order on $\Qbar$ we must also specify
an ordering of each set of Galois conjugates, algebraic numbers
that are roots of the same polynomial $g(X)$.  This could be done, for example, by fixing an
embedding of $\Qbar$ into $\C$ and representing elements of $\C$ as
vectors in $\R^2$ ordered lexicographically. But to apply this ordering to
elements of a number field $K=\Q(\alpha)$ would require fixing an
embedding of every such $K$ into $\Qbar$ in a way that is compatible
with respect to inclusion.  This may be possible but it
is certainly not easy to define and implement.

On balance we decided to use the ordering defined in \S\ref{sec:ordfix}, which allows us to compare algebraic numbers only as elements of a chosen ambient field with a fixed defining polynomial and generator.

\section{Sorting prime ideals}\label{sec:primes}
Fix a number field $K=\Q(\alpha)=\Q[X]/(g(X))$ with defining polynomial
$g\in\Z[X]$ and generator $\alpha$ as above, and let $\OO_K$ denote its ring of integers.
We do not assume that $K/\Q$ is Galois or that $\OO_K=\Z[\alpha]$.
By a \emph{prime} of $K$ (or of $\OO_K$) we mean a prime ideal in the ring $\OO_K$; for primes of $\Q$ we may also use $p$ to denote the prime ideal $(p)$.

We wish to define a total order on the set of prime ideals~$\p$
of $\OO_K$.  Let $(p)=\p\cap \Z$ be the prime of $\Z$ lying below $\p$,
let $e=e(\p/p)$ be the ramification index (the multiplicity of $\p$ in the prime factorization of $(p)$ in the Dedekind domain $\OO_K$), and let $f=f(\p/p)$ the residue field degree $[\OO_K/\p:\F_p]$.
The (absolute) norm of $\p$ is then $N(\p)=p^f$.

%% In \Sage, if $\p=${\tt P} is the prime ideal then its norm is
%% $N(\p)=${\tt P.norm()}, the underlying prime $p$ can be computed as $p=${\tt
%%  P.smallest\_integer()}, the
%% ramification index is $e=${\tt P.ramification\_index()}, and the residue degree is $f=${\tt
%%   P.residue\_class\_degree()}.

We order the primes $\p$ first by norm and then by the ramification index.
It remains only to order the primes~$\p$ of $K$ that lie above the same rational prime $p$ and have the same norm (hence the same residue degree) and ramification index.  Such primes will necessarily have the same value of $p^{ef}$; the converse need not hold (primes with the same value of $p^{ef}$ need not have the same norm), but this will not concern us since we order by norm first.

\subsection{The case of unramified primes}

Our general method is simplest when $p$ is unramified, not just in $K$
but in the order $\Z[\alpha]$; this holds precisely when $p\nmid [\OO_K:\Z[\alpha]]\disc(K)$, equivalently, $p\nmid\disc(g)$, which applies to all but finitely many $p$.  In this case $g(X)$ factors modulo~$p$ into distinct irreducible elements of $\Fp[X]$, and we may
write
\[
    g(X) \equiv \prod_i h_i(X) \pmod{p},
\]
with the factors $h_i(X)\in\Z[X]$ monic and such that their reductions
modulo~$p$ are distinct and irreducible.  We may assume that the
coefficients of each $h_i(X)$ are reduced modulo~$p$ to integers in the interval $[0,p-1]$, and we order these factors first by degree and then lexicographically by their coefficient vectors in $[0,p-1]^{f+1}$.

The Dedekind-Kummer theorem allows us to associate to each factor
$h_i(X)$ the prime ideal $\p_i=(p,h_i(\alpha))$ above $p$, with
residue degree $f(\p_i/p)=\deg h_i$ and norm $N(\p_i)=p^{\deg h_i}$.
We then have $p\OO_K=\prod_i \p_i$ and our ordering of the $h_i$
induces an ordering of the primes~$\p_i$ above $p$.  If we have any
representation of $\p_i$ in the form $\p_i=(p,\beta)$ where
$\beta=b(\alpha)$ for some $b(X)\in\Z[X]$, then we can recover
$h_i(X)$ since $h_i(X)=\gcd(g(X),b(X))$ (with the $\gcd$ computed in
$\F_p[X]$).  This follows from the observation that
$\ord_{\p_i}(\beta)>0$ while $\ord_{\p_j}(\beta)=0$ for all primes
$\p_j$ above~$p$ other than~$\p_i$.  This makes implementation of the
sorting function on the primes above~$p$ very simple in this case.

\subsection{The general case, including ramified and unramified primes}

There is a bijection between the distinct primes $\p$ above $p$ and
the irreducible factors $h(X)$ of $g(X)$ in $\Q_p[X]$ in which $\deg h
= e(\p/p)f(\p/p)$ \cite[Theorem 3.8 (d)]{Janusz}.  Write
\[
  g(X) = h_1(X)h_2(X)\dots h_r(X)
\]
with the $h_i(X)$ monic and irreducible in $\Z_p[X]$. Since we sort prime ideals
by norm and ramification index, it is enough to describe an order on polynomials
of the same degree (in fact we are interested only in those polynomials $h_i(X)$
that not only have the same degree, but correspond to primes $\p_i$ with the same
ramification index and residue degree, which may be a proper subset).

We sort polynomials in~$\Z_p[X]$ of degree~$d$ as follows. Such a polynomial~$P$
can be written in the form
\[
  (a_{0,0}+a_{0,1}p+a_{0,2}p^2+\dots) + (a_{1,0}+a_{1,1}p+\dots)X
  + \dots + (a_{d,0}+a_{d,1}p+\dots)X^d,
\]
with and~$a_{i,j}\in\Z\cap[0,p-1]$. We can then attach to~$P$ the infinite
vector
\[
(a_{0,0},a_{1,0},\dots,a_{d,0},a_{0,1},a_{1,1},\dots,a_{d,1},a_{0,2},\dots)\in [0,p-1]^\infty,
\]
and we sort polynomials according to the lexicographic ordering of such vectors.
Comparisons can be made using finite precision, provided that the polynomials are known to be
distinct, which is the case for the~$h_i$.

%In what follows it will be sufficient to know the
%$h_i$ to finite $p$-adic precision.
%Let $k\ge1$ be an integer such that the $f_i(X)$ are distinct
%modulo~$p^k$.  We may take $k=1$ if and only if $p$ is unramified (in
%the sense that it does not divide $\disc f$).  Denote by $h_i^k(X)$
%the unique monic polynomial in $\Z[X]$ with coefficients $c$
%satisfying $0\le c\le p^k-1$ which is congruent to $h_i(X)\pmod{p^k}$.
%Then the ordering of the $h_i(X)$ of the same degree defined in the
%previous paragraph as the same as the ordering of the $h_i^k(X)$ by
%lexicographical ordering of their integer coefficient vectors.

We now explain how to compute the bijection between the~$h_i$ and the primes
above~$p$. Let~$h\in\Z_p[X]$ be one of the~$h_i$, and let~$\p$ be a prime
above~$p$. The valuation~$v_{\p}$ on the number field~$K$ (a finite \'etale $\Q$-algebra) extends to the \'etale $\Q_p$-algebra ~$K\otimes_{\Q}\Q_p = \prod_i
\Q_p[X]/(h_i(X))$ obtained via base-change in the following way.
Let~$j$ be such that~$h_{j}$ corresponds
to~$\p$, and let~$v_j$ be the valuation of the $p$-adic field~$\Q_p[X]/(h_j(X))$.
Define the extension of~$v_\p$ to $K\otimes_\Q\Q_p$ to be the composition of the maps
\[
  K\otimes_{\Q}\Q_p \longrightarrow \Q_p[X]/(h_j(X)) \stackrel{v_j}{\longrightarrow} \Z\cup\{\infty\}.
\]
%by using the valuation on the factor corresponding to~$\p$,
%which is a $p$-adic field.
We then have~$v_{\p}(h(\alpha)) = \infty$ if and only
if~$\p$ corresponds to~$h$.
This valuation cannot be computed using finite
approximations to~$h$, however, for all integers~$k\ge 1$ we have~$v_\p((p^k,h(\alpha)))
= \min(e(\p/p)k, v_\p(h(\alpha)))$ equal to~$e(\p/p)k$
if~$h$ corresponds to~$\p$ and bounded above otherwise (independent of~$k$). The
valuation~$v_\p((p^k,h(\alpha)))$ can be computed using finite approximations
to~$h$, and if $k$ is such that the set $\{v_\p((p^k,h_i(\alpha)))\}$ has a unique maximum, this maximum occurs for the polynomial $h_i(X)$ corresponding to $\p$.
Thus we can compute the bijection by making $k$ sufficiently large (and any $k$ that yields a unique maximum works).

We remark that ``Round 4" of the $p$-adic polynomial factorization
algorithm implemented in \Pari\ \cite{Roblot} computes the prime
ideals corresponding to the various $p$-adic factors, but this part of
the output is not available via the standard interface.  The same is
true in \Sage, which uses the \Pari\ library for $p$-adic
factorization.  Nevertheless, the discussion above allows us to
recover the bijection without requiring direct access to this
implementation, which may not be the same in other computer algebra
systems in any case.

%For each prime $\p\mid p$ there is a unique index~$i$ such that
%$\ord_{\p}(h_i^k(\alpha))$ is strictly greater than all other
%$\ord_{\p}(h_j^k(\alpha))$.  For example, in the unramified case when
%$k=1$, $\ord_{\p}(h_i^1(\alpha))>0$ for one value of~$i$, while
%$\ord_{\p}(h_j^1(\alpha))=0$ for $j\not=i$.  We prove this as follows:
%
%For each $i$ let $\alpha_i\in\Qpbar$ be a root of $h_i(X)$.  There are
%$g$ different embeddings of $K$ into $\Qpbar$, up to conjugacy,
%defined by mapping $\alpha$ to $\alpha_i$ for $1\le i\le g$.  Since
%$h_i(\alpha_i)=0$ while $h_i(\alpha_j)\not=0$ for $j\not=i$, we have
%that $\lim_{k\to\infty}h_i^k(\alpha_i)=0$ while
%$\lim_{k\to\infty}h_i^k(\alpha_j)\not=0$ for $j\not=0$.
%
%Each field $\Q_p(\alpha_i)$ is the completions $K_{\p_i}$ of $K$ at
%some prime~$\p_i$ above~$p$, and the absolute value in each
%$\Q_p(\alpha_i)$ is that induced by the $\p_i$-adic valuation on $K$
%and on $\Q_p(\alpha_i)$.  Hence the limits in the previous paragraph
%are equivalent to saying that
%\[
%    \lim_{k\to\infty}\ord_{\p_i}(h_i^k(\alpha)) = \infty,
%\]
%while $\ord_{\p_j}(h_i^k(\alpha))$ remains bounded as $k\to\infty$ for
%$j\not=i$.  Thus for large enough $k$, $\ord_{\p_i}(h_i^k(\alpha))$ is
%strictly greater that $\ord_{\p_i}(h_j^k(\alpha))$ for all $j\not=i$.
%We can use this fact to uniquely assigned one of the $h_i^k$ to each
%$\p_i$ and use the ordering of the $h_i$ defined above to order the
%$\p_i$.
%
%In order to implement this in practice we need to know how large value
%of $k$ is needed.  Is it sufficient for $k$ to be such that the sets
%$\{\ord_{\p_i}(h_j^k(\alpha)) \mid 1\le j\le g\}$ have a unique
%maximal element, for all~$i$?  If so we can start with some $k$ and
%increase it until this property holds.  This will be easier than
%deciding in advance which $k$ work, in terms of the $p$-adic valuation
%of $\disc f$ perhaps.

\subsection{Examples}
Let $K=\Q(\alpha)$ be non-Galois cubic field \href{www.lmfdb.org/NumberField/3.1.503.1}{\texttt{3.1.503.1}} of discriminant $-503$ with canonical defining polynomial $g(x)=X^3-X^2+2X+8$.
The prime $2$ is unramified, but it divides $\disc(g(X))=-2^2\cdot 503$ and is an essential divisor of $[\OO_K:\Z[\alpha]]$ in the sense that this is true for every algebraic integer $\alpha$ in $K$ (this example, due to Dedekind, is the standard example of a non-monogenic field).

Let $p=2$ and $k=2$; the $2$-adic factors of $g(X)$ are: $h_1=X+O(2^2)$,
$h_2=X+2+O(2^2)$, $h_3=X+1+O(2^2)$.  So there are $3$
primes above $2$, each with residue degree $1$.
Calling these $\p_a = (2,\frac 12\alpha^2+\frac 12\alpha+3)$, $\p_b =
(2,\alpha+3)$, $\p_c = (2,\frac 12\alpha^2-\frac 12\alpha)$ in random order we find that
\begin{itemize}
  \item the $\p_a$-valuations of the $(2^2,h_i(\alpha))$ are $(1,2,0)$,
  \item the $\p_b$-valuations of the $(2^2,h_i(\alpha))$ are $(0,0,2)$,
  \item the $\p_c$-valuations of the $(2^2,h_i(\alpha))$ are $(2,1,0)$,
\end{itemize}
thus $\p_1=\p_c$, $\p_2=\p_a$ and $\p_3=\p_b$.

Let $p=503$.  There are two primes above~$p$ both of norm~$p$, only
one of which is ramified (with $e=2$). Our ordering puts the
unramified prime first and the ramified prime second, so we do not even need to
look at the $p$-adic factorization of $g(X)$ in this case.  In fact,
with $k=2$ we find factors $X+191929+O(503^2)$ and $X^2+61079X+87617+O(503^2)$.

For a larger example, let $K=\Q(\alpha)=\Q[X]/(g(X))$, where
\[
g(X)= X^{10} - 3X^9 - 35X^8 + 120X^7 + 242X^6 - 1080X^5 + 44X^4 + 2343X^3 -
1631X^2 + 111X + 79.
\]
This field has LMFDB
label~\href{http://beta.lmfdb.org/NumberField/10.10.24952891341003125.1}{\texttt{10.10.24952891341003125.1}} and discriminant~$5^5 41^8$, but we have
\[
\disc(g)=3^{12}\cdot 5^5\cdot 41^8\cdot 2141^2\cdot 26641^2.
\]
Let us consider the primes above $3$.
Over~$\Q_3$, the polynomial $g(X)$ splits as
a product of~$5$ polynomials of degree~$2$, that is, $g = h_1h_2h_3h_4h_5$ with
$h_i\in\Z_3[x]$. Modulo~$3$, we have
\begin{itemize}
  \item $h_1 = X^2 + 1 +O(3)$,
  \item $h_2 = X^2 + 2X + 2 + O(3)$,
  \item $h_3 = X^2 + X + 2 + O(3)$,
  \item $h_4 = X^2 + 2X + 2 + O(3)$,
  \item $h_5 = X^2 + X + 2 + O(3)$.
\end{itemize}
The prime $3$ is unramified, so we can already see that it splits into 5 primes of norm $9$.  These approximations are not sufficient to distinguish all the $h_i$,
but we get the following initial segments of the associated vectors (omitting
the maximal degree term since they are all monic):
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(1,0,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,2,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,1,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,2,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,1,\dots)$,
\end{itemize}
so we have~$h_1 < h_3,h_5 < h_2,h_4$. Modulo~$9$, we get
\begin{itemize}
  \item $h_1 = X^2 + 3X + 1 + O(3^2)$,
  \item $h_2 = X^2 + 5X + 5 + O(3^2)$,
  \item $h_3 = X^2 + 7X + 2 + O(3^2)$,
  \item $h_4 = X^2 + 5X + 5 + O(3^2)$,
  \item $h_5 = X^2 + 4X + 5 + O(3^2)$.
\end{itemize}
This is still not enough to distinguish them, but
we get the refined initial segments
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(1,0,0,1,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,2,1,1,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,1,0,2,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,2,1,1,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,1,1,1,\dots)$,
\end{itemize}
so we have~$h_1<h_3<h_5<h_2,h_4$. Finally, modulo~$27$ we have
\begin{itemize}
  \item $h_1 = X^2 + 3X + 1 + O(3^3)$,
  \item $h_2 = X^2 + 5X + 5 + O(3^3)$,
  \item $h_3 = X^2 + 7X + 11 + O(3^3)$,
  \item $h_4 = X^2 + 23X + 23 + O(3^3)$,
  \item $h_5 = X^2 + 13X + 14 + O(3^3)$.
\end{itemize}
This is now enough to distinguish all the~$h_i$, and we obtain the initial segments
\begin{itemize}
  \item $(1,0,0,1,0,0\dots)$,
  \item $(2,2,1,1,0,0,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,1,0,2,1,0,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,2,1,1,2,2,\dots)$,
  \item $(2,1,1,1,1,1,\dots)$,
\end{itemize}
yielding the order~$h_1 < h_3 < h_5 < h_2 < h_4$.
As noted above, the prime~$3$ decomposes as a product of~$5$ prime ideals of norm~$9$,
which we denote~$\p_a, \dots, \p_e$ in arbitrary order. We know that we need
precision at least~$O(3^3)$ to distinguish the polynomials~$h_i$, so we compute
the valuations~$v_\p((3^3,h_i(\alpha)))$. We obtain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The~$\p_a$-valuations of~$(3^3,h_i(\alpha))$ are~$(0,0,0,0,3)$,
  \item The~$\p_b$-valuations of~$(3^3,h_i(\alpha))$ are~$(0,3,0,2,0)$,
  \item The~$\p_c$-valuations of~$(3^3,h_i(\alpha))$ are~$(3,0,1,0,0)$,
  \item The~$\p_d$-valuations of~$(3^3,h_i(\alpha))$ are~$(0,2,0,3,0)$,
  \item The~$\p_e$-valuations of~$(3^3,h_i(\alpha))$ are~$(1,0,3,0,0)$,
\end{itemize}
thus we have the bijection~$\p_a\leftrightarrow h_5$, $\p_b\leftrightarrow h_2$,
$\p_c\leftrightarrow h_1$, $\p_d\leftrightarrow h_4$, $\p_e\leftrightarrow h_3$.
Since these ideals all have norm~$9$ and ramification index~$1$, our ordering of
the primes above~$3$ is~$\p_c < \p_e < \p_a < \p_b < \p_d$.

\section{Sorting all nonzero integral ideals}

Fix a number field $K=\Q(\alpha)$ with defining polynomial
$g(X)\in\Z[X]$ and generator $\alpha$ as above. 
We now define a total order on the set of all nonzero integral ideals of~$K$.
We always order ideals by norm, and then define some criteria to sort ideals of
the same norm. This defines for each ideal~$\a$ a unique label~$N.i$, where~$N$
is the norm of~$\a$ and~$i\ge 1$ is the rank of~$\a$ in the ordered list of
ideals of norm~$N$.
The order we choose has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item prime ideals are smaller than every non-prime ideal of the same norm,
    and are ordered in the same way as before;
  \item if~$\a,\b,\idc$ are integral ideals such that~$\a<\b$, then~$\a\idc<\b\idc$
    i.e. our ordering makes the set of nonzero integral ideals a totally ordered
    monoid;
  \item if the factorisation of a positive integer~$N$ is known, then the
    bijection between ideals of norm~$N$ and their labels is computable in
    polynomial time (even though the number of such ideals might not be
    polynomial in~$\log N$).

\subsection{Ideals of prime power norm}\label{sec:primepowernorm}

We first define an order on the set of ideals of prime power norm. Let~$\a$ be
an ideal of norm~$p^n$, and let~$\p_1,\dots,\p_r$ be the prime ideals of~$K$
above~$p$, ordered as in Section~\ref{sec:primes}. We have~$\a = \p_1^{v_1}\dots
\p_r^{v_r}$ for some integers~$v_i\ge 0$. We define the weight of this
factorization to be~$v_1+\dots+v_r$. We order ideals of norm a power of $p$ by
increasing norm first, then increasing weight, and finally by reverse
lexicographic order of the vector of exponents~$(v_1,\dots,v_r)$. For this
order, the prime ideals come first, and are ordered in the same way as
previously.

Example: let~$K$ be a number field and~$p$ a prime number that decomposes in~$K$
as the product~$\p_1\p_2\p_3\p_4$ where~$\p_1$, $\p_2$ and~$\p_3$ have residue
degree~$1$ and~$\p_4$ has residue degree~$2$. We assume that the order defined
in Section~\ref{sec:primes} gives~$\p_1 < \p_2 < \p_3$. We first consider ideals
of norm~$p$. The only such ideals are~$\p_1$, $\p_2$ and~$\p_3$, and they have weight~$1$
and exponent vectors~$(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$ and~$(0,0,1,0)$. Since
lexicographically we have~$(0,0,1,0)<(0,1,0,0)<(1,0,0,0)$, the reverse
lexicographic order gives~$\p_1<\p_2<\p_3$. Now
consider ideals of norm~$p^2$: $\p_4$, $\p_1^2$, $\p_2^2$, $\p_3^2$, $\p_1\p_2$,
$\p_1\p_3$ and~$\p_2\p_3$. The corresponding exponent vectors are~$(0,0,0,1)$,
$(2,0,0,0)$, $(0,2,0,0)$, $(0,0,2,0)$, $(1,1,0,0)$, $(1,0,1,0)$ and~$(0,1,1,0)$,
with weights~$1,2,2,2,2,2,2$. The order we defined is therefore~$\p_4 < \p_1^2 <
\p_1\p_2 < \p_1\p_3 < \p_2^2 < \p_2\p_3 < \p_3^2$. The reader can check that the
ideals of norm~$p^3$ are~$\p_4\p_1 < \p_4\p_2 < \p_4\p_3 < \p_1^3 < \p_1^2\p_2 <
\p_1^2\p_3 < \p_1\p_2^2 < \p_1\p_2\p_3 < \p_1\p_3^2 < \p_2^3 < \p_2^2\p_3 <
\p_2\p_3^2 < \p_3^3$.

\subsection{Arbitrary integral ideals}

We finally define an order on the set of all nonzero integral ideals. We first order
them by norm, so we only have to define an order on nonzero ideals of the same
norm. Let~$\a$ be an ideal of norm~$N = p_1^{a_1}\dots p_k^{a_k}$ with~$p_1 <
\dots < p_k$. Then~$\a$ has a unique factorization as~$\a = \a_1\dots\a_k$
where~$\a_i$ has norm~$p_i^{a_i}$. We order ideals of norm~$N$ according to the
lexicographic order of the $k$-uple~$(\a_1,\dots,\a_k)$.

Example: let~$K$ be a number field, and assume that~$2$ decomposes
as~$\p_1\p_2\p_3$ where~$\p_1<\p_2$ have residue degree~$1$ and~$\p_3$ has
residue degree~$2$, and that~$3$ decomposes as~$\q_1\q_2$ where~$\q_1$ has
degree~$1$ and~$\q_2$ has degree~$3$. Let us order ideals of norm~$18$. Such an
ideal is a product of an ideal of norm~$2$ and an ideal of norm~$9$. The ideals
of norm~$2$ are~$\p_1 < \p_2$, and the only ideal of norm~$9$ is~$\q_1^2$. The
ideals of norm~$18$ are therefore~$\p_1\q_1^2 < \p_2\q_1^2$. Let us now order ideals
of norm~$108 = 2^2\cdot 3^3$. The ideals of norm~$4$ are~$\p_3 < \p_1^2 < \p_1\p_2 <
\p_2^2$, and the ideals of norm~$27$ are~$\q_2 < \q_1^3$. The ideals of
norm~$108$ are therefore~$\p_3\q_2 < \p_3\q_1^3 < \p_1^2\q_2 < \p_1^2\q_1^3 <
\p_1\p_2\q_2 < \p_1\p_2\q_1^3 < \p_2^2\q_2 < \p_2^2\q_1^3$.
